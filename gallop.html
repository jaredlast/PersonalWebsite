      <strong>Vengeance is Mine</strong><br>
      Shohei Imamura 1979<br class="br">
      I didn't really have any idea what this movie was about going into it. I thought based on the title that it would be a Takeshi Kitano style 
      revenge movie. There was an interesting interview with the director Shohei Imamura included on the DVD. He seemed to have disdain for actors and 
      had been working exclusively in documentaries for almost a decade before coming back with this movie. It is interesting seeing handheld camera shots
      in a movie this old, following the main character Iwao Enokiza around the city, in and out of train stations. I need to go back and watch Stray Dog
      to see how this compares.
