          <strong> Maximum Risk</strong><br>
          Ringo Lam 1996<br class="br">
          This movie was way more fun than I thought it would be. I had watched Double Team the week before and was really disappointed
          with how poor that movie was so my expectations weren't terribly high for this one. <br class="br">
          The action set pieces were all fantastic, both the martial arts as well as the vehicle set pieces. 
          They went with a semi plausible plot for Jean Claude Van Damme to play twins unlike his earlier movie Double Impact. 
          They didn't make the same mistake of Double Impact where they had both twins on screen at the same time using some poor compositing
          techniques.

        <strong>A Better Tomorrow</strong><br>
        John Woo 1986<br class="br">
        I first saw A Better Tomorrow when it was broadcast on SBS as part of their Saturday night Cult Movie block presented by Des Mangan 
        back the the mid 90s. It was my introduction to the more visceral depictions of action in Hong Kong cinema, having been more familiar with 
        with Jackie Chan's light hearted approach to action prior. <br class="br">
        It still held up really well, Chow Yun Fat is so much fun to watch.
